# Key `Pandas.DataFrame`s in `eval.py`
We use the same local variable names for key DataFrames across functions in `eval.py` to be consistent. 
Please read more details of such variables in the docstrings/comments inside `eval.py` 

1. `dataset_df`: A summary human evaluation dataset represented as a `pandas.DataFrame`. 
   The following columns must be there: 
   * ArticleText
   * System -- the name of the system/summarizer
   * SystemSummary -- a system summary generated by the `System` at the same row
   * ReferenceSummary -- corresponding reference summary provided by the dataset 
   * Various columns of human evaluation aspects, as defined in `env.human_metrics`
2. `batch_result_df`: Each row corresponds to a sample and each column corresponds to a MultiIndex `(approach, model, score_name)`. `score_name` is a variant of a `model`, for example, ROUGE-1 is a `score_name` for ROUGE which is a `model`. 
3. `corr_df`: The correlation coefficient dataframe, the last column which is like
